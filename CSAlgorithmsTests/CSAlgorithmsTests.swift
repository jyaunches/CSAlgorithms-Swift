             Solution discusion:
             The key to a recursive solution is to keep in mind a shifting buffer. All towers should be used as buffers towers.
             
             Consider the problem of moving 2 disks first.
             
             You're going to first move the smallest item to the buffer. Followed by moving the larger disk to the destination, then the disk on the buffer back on top of the destination.
             
             1. Move disk count - 1 to the buffer.
             2. Move 1 disk to the destination.
             3. Move disk count - 1 from buffer to the destination.             
             
             Total number of moves should be 2^n-1 where n = number of disks
